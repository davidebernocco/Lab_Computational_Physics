# Computational Physics
In this directory you will find the worked out codes alongside the relative assignments proposed during an introductory course on computational scientific algoritms (UniTs). 

Although Fortran was originally suggested, the programming language I eventually choose is Python: when heavier pieces of code were requested, a significative speed up was reached through the Just-In-Time compiler 'numba'.
